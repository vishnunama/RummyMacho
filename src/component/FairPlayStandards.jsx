      <h3>1.1 Anti-Cheating and Anti-Collusion</h3>
      <h4>1.1.1 Individual Participation</h4>
      <p>All games on Rummymacho are intended to be played individually. Use of any external aids or third-party software, including cheats, bots, or hacks, to alter gameplay is strictly forbidden.

      <h3>1.2 Money Laundering</h3>
